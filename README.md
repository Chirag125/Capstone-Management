The Capstone Management System empowers students by allowing them to form teams and select project domains based on their interests. Through the platform, students can identify professors with shared research interests, fostering mentorship. A panel of professors periodically evaluates and updates project marks, providing valuable feedback. This system enhances project management strategies, ensuring a collaborative and effective approach to final year projects.
