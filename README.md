## Project Overview :

This project outlines a comprehensive database system to support the management of university research projects. It enables the tracking of faculty members, students, their roles in research teams, and the assessment of student performance through reviews. The system also allows for the categorization of research by domain of study, making it a valuable tool for universities to efficiently manage and monitor their research initiatives. Researchers and administrators can utilise this system to allocate resources, track the student scores and enhance collaboration among faculty and students for the capstone project.					
Detailed profiles for students and professors will be maintained, including personal information, contact details, academic qualifications, and review history.					
The system make it easier for teams of students to select professors based on their academic needs and project preferences.	

## System requirements :

#### 1.User authentication:					
This feature distinguishes between administrators, professors, students, and judges, each assigned specific privileges. It mandates secure login with username and password.						
#### 2.Performance Tracking:					
The system allows administrators, professors, and panel judges to monitor the progress of student groups throughout the project lifecycle.			
#### 3.Capstone Evaluation Tracking:
This system captures the scores for each phase of the capstone project, detailing both internal and external evaluations where applicable.
